The two most common methods for measuring this are the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) and the viral neutralization assay (NT), which have not been systematically compared for a large number of influenza viruses. A total of 151 study participants from near Guangzhou, China, were enrolled in 2009 and provided serum. HI and NT assays were performed for 12 historic and recently circulating strains of seasonal influenza A. We compared titers using Spearman correlation and fit models to predict NT using HI results. We observed high positive mean correlation between HI and NT assays (Spearman's rank correlation, ?=.86) across all strains. Correlation was highest within subtypes and within close proximity in time. Overall, an HI=20 corresponded to NT=10, and HI=40 corresponded to NT=20. Linear regression of log(NT) on log(HI) was statistically significant, with age modifying this relationship. Strain-specific area under a curve (AUC) indicated good accuracy (>80%) for predicting NT with HI. While we found high overall correspondence of titers between NT and HI assays for seasonal influenza A, no exact equivalence between assays could be determined. This was further complicated by correspondence between titers changing with age. These findings support generalized comparison of results between assays and give further support for use of the hemagglutination inhibition assay over the more resource intensive viral neutralization assay for seasonal influenza A, although attention should be given to the effect of age on these assays.\\n\"]\n",

An aggregated form of the enzyme with a low specific activity can be separated from the monomer by gel filtration; treatment of the aggregate with mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol results in an increase in enzymic activity and a regeneration of the monomer. Also, multiple molecular forms of the monomer have been detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The unresolved enzyme exhibits two pH optima (pH 4.5 and pH 7.0) with dihydrofolate as a substrate. Highest activities are observed in buffers containing large organic cations. In 100 mM imidazolium chloride (pH 7), the specific activity is 47 mumol of dihydrofolate reduced per min per mg at 30 degrees. Folic acid also serves as a substrate with a single pH optimum of pH 4.5. At this pH the Km for folate is 16 muM, and the Vmax is 1/1000 of the rate observed with dihydrofolate as the substrate. Monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) inhibit dihydrofolate reductase; at a given ionic strength the degree of inhibition is a function of the ionic radius of the cation. Divalent cations are more potent inhibitors; the I50 of BaCl2 is 250 muM, as compared to 125 mM for KCl.

We have purified both forms of phosphorylase from rat liver and studied the characteristics of each. Phosphorylase b activity can be measured with our assay conditions. The phosphorylase b we obtained was stimulated by high concentrations of sulfate, and was a substrate for muscle phosphorylase kinase whereas phosphorylase a was inhibited by sulfate, and was a substrate for liver phosphorylase phosphatase. Substrate binding to phosphorylase b was poor (KM glycogen = 2.5 mM, glucose-1-P = 250 mM) compared to phosphorylase a (KM glycogen = 1.8 mM, KM glucose-1-P = 0.7 mM). Liver phosphorylase b was active in the absence of AMP. However, AMP lowered the KM for glucose-1-P to 80 mM for purified phosphorylase b and to 60 mM for the enzyme in crude extract (Ka = 0.5 mM). Using appropriate substrate, buffer and AMP concentrations, assay conditions have been developed which allow determination of phosphorylase a and 90% of the phosphorylase b activity in liver extracts. Interconversion of the two forms can be demonstrated in vivo (under acute stimulation) and in vitro with little change in total activity. A decrease in total phosphorylase activity has been observed after prolonged starvation and in diabetes.\\n']]\n"

Enthlpies are reported for various steps in the bleaching of rhodopsin in intact rod outer segment membranes, together with the heats of appropriate model reactions. Protonation changes are also determined calorimetrically by use of buffers with differing heats of proton ionization. Bleaching of rhodopsin is accompanied by significant uptake of heat energy, vastly in excess of the energy required for simple isomerization of the retinal chromophore. Metarhodopsin I formation involves the uptake of about 17 kcal/mol and no net change in proton ionization of the system. Formation of metarhodopsin II requires an additional energy of about 10 kcal/mol and involves the uptake on one hydrogen ion from solution. The energetics of the overall photolysis reaction, rhodopsin leads to opsin + all-trans-retinal, are pH dependent and involve the exposure of an additional titrating group on opsin. This group has a heat of proton ionization of about 12 kcal/mal, characteristic of a primary amine, but a pKa in the region of neutrality. We suggest that this group is the Schiff base lysine of the chromophore binding site of rhodopsin which becomes exposed on photolysis. The low pKa for this active lysine would result in a more stable retinal-opsin linkage, and might be induced by a nearby positively charged group on the protein (either arginine or a second lysine residue). This leads to a model involving intramolecular protonation of the Schiff base nitrogen in the retinal-opsin linkage of rhodopsin, which is consistent with the thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of the system. We further propose that the metarhodopsin I leads to metarhodopsin II step in the bleaching sequence involves reversible hydrolysis of the Schiff base linkage in the chromophore binding site, and that subsequent steps are the result of migration of the chromophore from this site.\\n'], ['17755', 'Ultrastructural features of osmotic shock in mussel gill cilia', '', 'animals$$bivalvia$$cilia$$colchicine$$cytosol$$hydrogen-ion concentration$$microtubules$$movement$$osmolar concentration$$osmotic pressure$$polyethylene glycols$$vinblastine', '\\n'], ['28220', 'Studies on the microsomal metabolism and binding of polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs)', '', 'animals$$biotransformation$$biphenyl compounds$$dna$$female$$lactation$$male$$methylcholanthrene$$microsomes, liver$$milk$$nadp$$phenobarbital$$polybrominated biphenyls$$pregnancy$$protein binding$$rats', \"The metabolism of polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) was studied in vitro by using rat liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH and atmospheric O2. Quantitative recoveries of all PBBs were obtained after incubations with control or 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) induced microsomes. Of the twelve major components, losses of only peaks 1 (2,4,5,2',5'-pentabromobiphenyl) and 3 (a hexabromobiphenyl) were observed following incubations with microsomes from phenobarbital (PB)- or PBBS- pretreated rats. Of seven structurally identified PBB components, only peak 1 has a bromine-free para position. Peaks 1, 2, and 5 all have two adjacent unsubstituted carbons, yet only peak 1 is metabolized. Of two dibromobiphenyl model compounds studied, the 2,2'-congener was very rapidly metabolized by PB-induced microsomes whereas its 4,4'-isomer was not. These results suggest that the presence of a free para position is required for the metabolism of brominated biphenyls. Of lesser importance appears to be the number of bromines or the availability of two adjacent unsubstituted carbons. In vivo evidence for the metabolism of peaks 1 and 3 was also provided by their drastically diminished levels in liver and milk extracts. When a 14C-PBB mixture consisting almost exclusively of peaks 4 (2,4,5,2',4',5'-hexabromobiphenyl) and 8 (2,3,4,5,2',4',5'-heptabromobiphenyl) was incubated with PB- or PBBs- induced microsomes and NADPH, only traces of radioactivity remained with the microsomes after extensive extraction. However, less radioactivity was bound to microsomes from MC pretreated or especially control rats. No radioactivity was bound to exogenous DNA included in similar microsomal incubations, regardless of the type of microsomes used. Under the same conditions, [3H]-benzo[a]pyrene metabolites were bound to DNA, and PBB-induced microsomes enhanced this binding more than six-fold.\\n\"]]\n"
